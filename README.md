# Portfolio site
## This is my first portfolio site, Made this from scratch with HTML,CSS & JS only
Code is a bit messy but I'll make another one soon and surely that one will be better.
I tried to design and develop the whole website, but I didn't build the backend as I felt like the website wasn't as good as I wanted to be.
So I'll be making another one and will build backend there.

### here's a little preview of the site -
